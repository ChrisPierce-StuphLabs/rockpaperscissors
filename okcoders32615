	block level elements vs inline level elements. 
block covers all of the horizon, div for instance, will push stuff below and above it
inline level elements allows you to tag and style content, a href="" for instance. images should be inline level elements.  
floating it to the left, for a div. it disrupts the horizontal breaking effect.
need a clear fix. <div style="clear:both;">  //both can be substituted for right, or left
nav and div are used for similar things, nav is used for html5.
<form action="#">  //means this page
<lable id=""> is used for uniquely idintifying stuff for css.

<input type="checkbox">

	javascript will let you change the type of the variable. varibles can hold any type in it. an expression evaluates to something. statements don't evaluate to something. statements dont have a result, it's used for something else. like an if statement. expressions dont need semicolons, statements usually do need semicolons. there are apparently no constants in javascript... wtf?? table,-> tr,-> td.     
javascript is lazily evaluated.
